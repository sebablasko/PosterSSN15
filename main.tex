% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%\blindtext[1]
The use of multithreading has become the first choice when we are looking for greater efficiency in performing tasks. However there are cases where this scenario is not possible to achieve with this technique, as the case of concurrent access of UDP sockets. This work collects profiling and testing techniques in Linux systems to prove how resource contention points that are not compatible with parallelizable schemes in a shared structure as a UDP socket, end up by transferring the extra cost to the real communication between processors. Finally is presented a simple and novel proposal to provide for efficiency in the context specified without penalizing the inter-processor communication channels.

\section{Introduction}
%\blindtext
Since the advent of multiprocessor machines, the trend has been to incorporate multi-threading to achieve better execution times. This is a possible phenomenon given by modern operating systems that have sophisticated mechanisms for scheduling, getting so the distribution of threads and tasks between different available processors (physical or logical), producing an effective gain in reducing the times.
\subsection*{The Problem}
%\blindtext
However, scaling in processing speed of a task is not always possible using these techniques. Known is the case where UDP sockets in a multicpu environment by incorporating multithreding, degradation is generated in the data consumption rate \cite{bib:diegoRivera, bib:hp}. Works on the same line are limited to attribute responsibility for this bad behavior to synchronization components present in low level UDP sockets implementation such as spinlocks, responsible for ensuring mutual exclusion access to the structure. In this way, the latter would be responsible for creating a point of contention resource when incorporating parallel readings. This situation degenerates into problems as a bottleneck in concurrent access, cache rebounds and problems of load distribution, that could increase as more cores have available \cite{bib:google}. However, this is a diagnosis that, being fully reasonable in theoretical terms, has not been completely experimentally demonstrated in a scenario as described.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=3.2in]{Imagenes/diagrama1}
  \caption{Diagram that illustrate how resource contention caused by the spinlock in UDP sockets influence inter cpu communication in multi core machines, degrading speed of processing. The $J_i$ represent differents jobs or tasks running in differents cores.}
  \label{fig:diag1}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Objectives}
The aim of this work is to propose a method for resource contentions verification at hardware level using components of modern processors, as well as providing a proposal to achieve improved performance in the use of UDP sockets in multiple CPU architectures.



\section{Method and Experimental Verification}
To demonstrate experimentally overuse problem in communication hardware components of the system, we can use analysis tools based on monitoring of the \emph{Performance Monitoring Unit} (PMU), components of modern processors that quantify the \emph{Performance Counters} associated. That Performance Counters let us count operation of low level such as, for example, reading in L2 cache, triggering a state change of consistency of a value in memory, etc. In practice reading Performance Counters can be performed using specialized software involved in the lower layers of the OS as \emph{Perf}, \emph{PAPI} and \emph{HPCTOOLKIT} \cite{bib:hpc} are.

\subsection{Hardware Specification}
For the above analysis, it is necessary to limit the experimental environment. Different manufacturers make different processor implementations to monitor events. This study is based on a machine of the following characteristics:

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=3.45in]{Imagenes/24cores}
  \caption{Diagram generated by \texttt{lstopo} tool that shows the inner hardware structure of the machine to test. It is a Server with two NUMA nodes, each one with an \emph{Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X5660 @ 2.80GHz} Processor of 6 Cores. It's also have HyperThreading, bringing a total amount of 24 logical Cores. About software, it's running \emph{CentOS release 6.5} with a \emph{Linux kernel 2.6.32\-431.el6.x86\_64.} version.}
  \label{fig:24cores}
\end{figure}

Given the processor model of our server and according to the manufacturer's specifications \cite{bib:manual} exist a collection of \emph{events} related to the \emph{Intel QuickPath Link} \cite{bib:intelQPI}, which is the Intel technology used in the communication channels between the different cores of each set of processors in the system. This is a crucial crossing point in multi-threaded applications as our experiment. By their nature, the behavior of that \emph{events} should have a relation in the performance of the data consumption of our experiment. Our hypotesis is that exists an specific set of \emph{events} that impact overruns by having a shared resource, the object of contention. In this way, we expect to find a similar behavior between events in its growth trend, according to the overrun found by increasing consumer threads. Table \ref{table:eventos} includes a group of events who involving a cost in time related to suspicions raised.

\caption{Total events collected in the evaluation of different threads consuming UDP Sockets. The events are divided into two groups: \textbf{QPI/GQ/Cache} for events related with movement of data between different structures of the hardware specification, and \textbf{LinkLayer} for the events referred to synchronization of consistency protocols and error correction layer that appear in cache bouncing scenarios.}
\label{table:eventos}
\end{table}


\subsection{The Experimentation}
For each event involved, we studied the number of signals generated while the number of consuming threads to a UDP socket was increased. The software used was \emph{PERF capture tool}. Thus, the sampling for each event was stored as a quantitative record of the number of calls from the event for a configuration of threads as follows:

$$Event_i=\left\{\overline{T_{i,j}}\right\}_{j=\left\{1,2,4,6,8,16,24,36,48,60\right\}}$$

Every $Event_i$ value is a tuple that store records of the different experiment for a configuration. The $i$ index represent an specific event of the table \ref{table:eventos} and $j$ index is the threads configuration of the test. Each $\overline{T_{i,j}}$ is the average value after 50 repetitions.

\end{subfigure}

\caption{Results of the registry of four events that reveals how the communication at Processor level grows up according with the increase of concurrent threads reading at UDP Socket.}
\label{fig:4events}
\end{figure}

The results showed in Fig. \ref{fig:4events} summaries two main trends in the measurement of the studied events. The first one (\ref{exp1}) is the trend of events like \verb=r500205= and \verb=r500404= that shows how when the limit of 24 threads is reached, the counted values increase dramatically. This is a expected measurement because 24 is the limit of processing cores avaliable in our machine. The second trend (\ref{exp2}) is the showed by events like \verb=r500204= and \verb=r530851=. In this case, the counted values increase in an important value with increasing threads, so it means a higher cost in communication channels respect to the first trend.

With the set of selected events, a correlation matrix was built\footnote{Built with Statgraphics software \url{http://www.statgraphics.com/}} to display the trend between the events and determine whether there is indeed a coincidence saturation channels. In fact, a bast mayority of the events are very correlated, and those  follows the trend showed in record as \verb=r530851= from the figure \ref{fig:4events} what is an important increase for every thread aggregation.

\begin{figure}[!h]

	\caption{Correlation matrix showing trends of events as they incorporate more threads consuming UDP socket, generated with Statgraphics software.}
	\label{fig:corrMatrix}
\end{figure}

With these results it can be established -as expected- that increasing access to UDP sockets using multiple threads, degrades the capacity to consume information in it, so that the best alternative would not incorporate concurrent access to these structures and just use a single thread per socket.

\section{The Proposal}

\subsection{Available Solutions}
To overcome the low performance of the threads in concurrent access to the UDP sockets have been proposed and developed different solutions. \textbf{Reuseport} is an option for sockets developed by Google programmers and available from Linux later than 3.0 kernel version, which allows applications to bind multiple sockets to the same port, delegating the work of the (always equitable) package distribution among the Kernel. In practice, this option improves performance taking advantage of a parallelism way using multiple internet sockets to reach a better time in the consumption of data from the same port.

The problem is that this option is not perfectly standard between Linux flavors, besides having poor technical documentation. Reuseport adds another problem: To work, the first bind to the desired port must be performed with a socket to which you have already enabled the \emph{SO\_RESUSEPORT} option, and thereafter new connections can be coupled in the same port. This stage, beyond breaking one of the basic principles of network programming (the parity 1 port to 1 socket), forces to modify the programming logic applications incorporating more settings when starting the connections.

Another good technique to take advantage of paralellism in this same way would be the use of \textbf{IPTables} to create rules to port forward packages directed to an specific port, and delegate the consumption of data to different tasks in different UDP sockets. In practice, this approach works, but configuring IPTables is commonly a hard and complex task.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=3.2in]{Imagenes/diagrama2}
  \caption{Diagram showing the proposed scheme, using the kernel module designed to redistribute the UDP packets among differents UDP sockets in differents tasks. In this way, the amount of work of each socket is reduced and the communication between tasks in differents cores is reduced.}
  \label{fig:diag2}
\end{figure}

Alternatively, it is proposed to design a modular, noninvasive, extensible and multi-system component that could exploit the advantages of Reuseport, retaining standard programming techniques. Considering these requirements, the development of a kernel module that using the \emph{Netfilters Framework} available in the system acts as a UDP proxy, intercepting incoming packets and evenly redistributed among a pool of selected ports when installing the module is postulated as the best option [REF UDPREDISTRIBUTEMODULE]. The proposal is modest, minimal and effective: As a kernel module, it is easily installed on any Linux platform and easily modified to, for example, add different package distribution routines depending on the environment of use. In addition to enabling an early and low overhead when running in kernel space intervention.
\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=3.4in]{Imagenes/graficoModulo}
  \caption{Experimental results that compare the performance of the use of multithread, Reuseport and kernel module approaches.}
  \label{fig:chart}
\end{figure}
In practice, the results obtained using the proposal are perfectly competitive compared to Reuseport, with the advantage that applications can maintain the classic scheme consuming programming ports that are configured as a destination port of redistribution.

\section{Future Work}
The simplicity of the proposal makes it flexible to evaluate their performance under different scenarios of load balancing, with multiple applications that consume certain UDP traffic. In that sense, the proposal opens the possibility of mounting systems in their heterogeneous hardware features which can be used as a load distributor with various applications. For example, if you have a computer with hardware of combined processing capabilities, distribute the load for the most intensive applications work always associated with the most powerful CPU and removing a small portion of traffic to applications on CPU lighter, could be an interesting approach.

\section{Conclusion}
%\blindtext
This study presented a case of how in server architectures, application of parallelism by multithreading degrades the reading of UDP sockets, showing that there is indeed a shared component between threads that need to be accessed by multiple CPU generates an increase in traffic in communication channels in this processor architecture. Thus, the suggestion of don't use such strategies of parallelism in structures such as UDP Sockets, which have a point of exploitable bottleneck, is confirmed.

Also, an alternative is presented to achieve a redistribution of packets equally among different UDP sockets getting comparable to techniques such Reuseport but with the advantage of being modular and extensible, opening a range of scenarios where it may be time considerably better that Reuseport.
